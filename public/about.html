<h1>About Me</h1>
<p>My name is Matthew Stradling, I am 24 and I'm in the process of becoming a Full Stack Web Developer.</p>

<p>Ever since I was younger, I have been fascinated by technology and always wanted to figure out how it worked and why. Programming in my opinion
  is one of the best ways to find out how technology works, and how the commands we give it, bring it all to life.
